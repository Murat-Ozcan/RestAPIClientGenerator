## Executive Summary
Every time a developer is implementing a Rest API, the plumbing work is very repetitive, tedious, and time consuming. This prototype will allow us to minimize the amount of work and time invested when we are consuming Rest APIs.

###The problem
Itâ€™s a very common task for almost any developer to implement Rest APIs, for each one of them, we are following almost the same steps in order to complete the integration. Those steps are too long, slow and monotonous.

###Solution
To resolve this problem, we are creating a tool to avoid developers implementing the steps required to create the Rest client manually. Our vision is to provide a Rest API Client Automated Generator that allow the developer to focus in what really matters.

###Goal for the prototype
This prototype will cover  the creation of the Rest Client based on the provided end point and parameters. The output will be a zip file with a .Net project.

## User Description
In this first version, any .Net Developer that needs to consume a Rest API can use it.
